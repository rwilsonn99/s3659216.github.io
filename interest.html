						<p>	 Unlike many other students who are partaking in this course, my interest in IT does not stem from passion but rather necessity. IT was one of two electives I was able to choose from in order to complete one of my semesters in my undergraduate degree: Bachelor of Applied Science (Psychology). I do however find the concept of IT interesting and began my studies in this course with an open mind. 
						<p>	 My interest in IT started the moment I began this course. My knowledge about the world of IT is extremely limited as I have had no experience at all with the innerworkings of information technology. 
						<p>	 No particular event or person sparked my interest in IT. My interest in this specific course was sparked purely based on the need I have to complete it as an elective, with myself personally having zero experience in the field of IT.
						<p>	 I decided to come to RMIT university based on the practical learning methods that RMIT utilises. I also found the many global links RMIT has and how the university itself is located in the heart of the CBD intriguing and attractive. Similarly, when looking at courses to apply for, RMIT displayed the best fit for what I was looking to study. 
						<p>	 I expect to learn from this specific course a basic understanding of information technology and the general concepts that surround it.  In regards to what I expect myself to have learnt after the completion of my degree (majoring in Psychology) two main things come to mind; the growth of multiple personal skills and qualities, as well as the increased knowledge about the theories and teachings in Psychology.
