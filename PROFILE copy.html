									PROJECT IDEA</h2>
								</header>
						<p style="text-decoration:underline;"><font color="#C982EC">OVERVIEW:</font></p>
						<p>The project idea I have come up with involves the creation of a website that provides resources and information for sufferers of anxiety to help alleviate symptoms, including anxiety attacks. This website would provide thousands of individuals with relief and comfort, helping them to manage their anxiety levels, and improve their day to day lives. The contents of the website would include basic information on what anxiety is and its symptoms, along with ideas of activities and exercises for users to participate in to help decrease symptoms.
							<p style="text-decoration:underline;"><font color="#C982EC">MOTIVATION:</font></p>
							<p>As a psychology student I am extremely passionate about potentially creating a tool that could help others. I think that my idea is an interesting concept for a project that could benefit many on a daily basis. I came up with this idea whilst sitting in one of my psychology lectures and finding out just how many individuals suffer with anxiety in our society. According to Beyond Blue - a support service for those who suffer with anxiety and/or depression - over 2 million Australians suffer with anxiety every year. This enormous number supports my motivation to create an website that will help these individuals.
								<p style="text-decoration:underline;"><font color="#C982EC">DESCRIPTION:</font></p>
								<p>In terms of my website’s design, I would want it to be simple enough to be used by individuals across all age groups who vary in levels of experience with technological systems. The features of this website would revolve around wellness practices that have been supported with studies and trials to help those suffering with anxiety find relief. This website would have various elements that would link together in various ways. The ideas for features/ sections of my website that I have come up with are discussed below.  
									<p>	- Information about anxiety and the purpose of the website:  In this section of my website I would include basic information on what anxiety is. This section would provide users with knowledge that would help them to understand what anxiety is, and how this website aims to help individuals who suffer with the mental illness. This section would also provide the friends and family members of anxiety sufferers with information to help raise awareness of the disorder.   
									<p>	- Practices and techniques that help combat anxiety:  This section would be one of the main features of the website. It would consist of various practices and techniques that have been proven to help alleviate anxiety. Users would be able to explore multiple practices and recommendations on how and what to do in certain anxiety fuelled situations.  
									<p>	- Audio meditation recordings:  This section would link various meditation recordings that users could listen to when in need. Each recording would have a description that stated the duration and content, as well as a recommendation on what ‘level’ of anxiety the specific recording was designed for.
									<p>	 - Information on where to find support and help:  This section of the website would include organisations, websites and phone numbers for users who are in need of support. This section would help to ensure that users never felt alone and always had access to sources that would provide them with help 24/7. 
		<p style="text-decoration:underline;"><font color="#C982EC">TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES:</font></p>
		<p>	As I have no experience in IT I am not entirely sure what software I would use to create this website. However, based on the steps I followed to create this website I believe I could use similar techniques to make my website come to life. I could utilise a pre-made html template, like i did for this website, to create the ‘bones’ of my website and alter the code in the app ‘Atom’ to personalise it in regards to content and design. 
				<p style="text-decoration:underline;"><font color="#C982EC">SKILLS REQUIRED:</font></p>
				<p>I would need to do extensive research about how exactly I would create my website but I do believe that I am able to gather all the content for my website from my studies in my psychology subjects. The skills required to create my project revolve around having a basic knowledge of how to use and understand html codes, and how to apply them to my specific project. I believe that by researching and practicing with html that I will find it feasible to create my desired project.
				<p style="text-decoration:underline;"><font color="#C982EC">OUTCOME:</font></p>
				<p>If this project is successful it will provide countless individuals with a resource that will help provide respite from the effects and symptoms caused by anxiety. This website will be simple enough to be used by anyone, no matter their age and level of experience with technological systems. The problem that involved sufferers of anxiety feeling alone or without resources to assist them in combating their anxieties will be solved, impacting society in a positive way. This development has the potential to help millions learn and cope about one of the most common mental disorders.
